//! Implementation of syscalls
//!
//! The single entry point to all system calls, [`syscall()`], is called
//! whenever userspace wishes to perform a system call using the `ecall`
//! instruction. In this case, the processor raises an 'Environment call from
//! U-mode' exception, which is handled as one of the cases in
//! [`crate::trap::trap_handler`].
//!
//! For clarity, each single syscall is implemented as its own function, named
//! `sys_` then the name of the syscall. You can find functions like this in
//! submodules, and you should also implement syscalls this way.

/// write syscall
const SYSCALL_WRITE: usize = 64;
/// exit syscall
const SYSCALL_EXIT: usize = 93;
/// yield syscall
const SYSCALL_YIELD: usize = 124;
/// gettime syscall
const SYSCALL_GET_TIME: usize = 169;
/// taskinfo syscall
const SYSCALL_TASK_INFO: usize = 410;
